To run the task management application with the implemented secure coding best practices, you need to install the following Node.js libraries using npm (Node Package Manager). Open your terminal in the project directory (`task-management-app/`) and run the following commands:

1.  **Express:** A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

    ```bash
    npm install express
    ```

2.  **body-parser:** Middleware to parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the `req.body` property.

    ```bash
    npm install body-parser
    ```

3.  **express-rate-limit:** Basic rate-limiting middleware for Express to limit repeated requests to APIs and prevent brute-force attacks.

    ```bash
    npm install express-rate-limit
    ```

4.  **helmet:** Helps secure Express apps by setting various HTTP headers. It can protect against well-known web vulnerabilities such as XSS, clickjacking, and more.

    ```bash
    npm install helmet
    ```

5.  **hpp:** HTTP Parameter Pollution protection middleware. It helps prevent attackers from injecting unexpected query parameters.

    ```bash
    npm install hpp
    ```

6.  **cors:** Provides Express middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). CORS is a mechanism that allows resources to be requested from another domain.

    ```bash
    npm install cors
    ```

7.  **morgan:** HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js. It logs information about incoming HTTP requests, which is useful for monitoring and debugging.

    ```bash
    npm install morgan
    ```

**Summary of Installation Commands:**

```bash
npm install express body-parser express-rate-limit helmet hpp cors morgan
```

After running these commands, Node.js will download and install these libraries and their dependencies into the `node_modules` directory within your project. You can then run your `app.js` file using `node app.js` to start the server.
